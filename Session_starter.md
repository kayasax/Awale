## 📝 **IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT REMINDER**
**⚠️ GitHub Pages Caching:** Always bump version in `packages/web/src/version.ts` before deploying to avoid browser caching issues!
- Current pattern: `0.6.0-AUDIO-STYLED` → `0.6.1-NEXT-FEATURE`
- This forces browsers to fetch the latest JavaScript/CSS files instead of using cached versions
- Remember: Version bump → Commit → Merge to master → Push (triggers GitHub Pages build)

## �📘 Project Context
**Project:** Awale
**Type:** General Development Project
**Purpose:** Build a calming, turn‑based Awale (Oware) board game experience playable directly inside Microsoft Teams 1:1 chats and (later) a Teams tab, emphasizing relaxation (ambient visuals + soft looping music), accessible rules learning, and optional AI opponent for solo play.
**Status:** 🚀 **DOCKER SERVER READY** - Multiplayer server successfully building and running

**Core Technologies (current):**

- Game Engine: Pure functional TypeScript module (logic + rules + AI)
- Teams Interaction: Azure Bot Service (Teams channel) with Adaptive Cards for board state & move selection
- Multiplayer Server: WebSocket server with Docker containerization for Azure deployment
- Web Interface: React + Vite (for multiplayer web client)
- Persistence (Phase 1 dev): In‑memory (per process) → Phase 2: Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Table Storage
- Container Deployment: Docker with Azure Container Apps target
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build, lint, test, deploy via azd or Azure CLI)

**Available AI Capabilities:**
- 🔧 MCP Servers: Azure best practices, Microsoft Docs search, (extendable as needed)
- 📚 Documentation: Microsoft Docs MCP for Teams, Bot Service, storage, security
- 🔍 Tools: Session continuity, planning TODO list, Azure guidance, code generation support

## 🧠 Technical Memory

**Critical Discoveries:**
- Vision clarified: Teams-based Awale with relaxation & optional AI.
- Early decision toward TypeScript + Bot Framework for fastest Teams iteration.
- Need clean pure engine to enable reuse (CLI tests, bot, future web UI).
- Azure best practice tooling accessible for secure, scalable evolution.

**Performance Insights (future focus):**
- Game engine lightweight; performance concerns shift to AI search pruning.
- Potential optimization: transposition table + iterative deepening for AI (phase 3+).
- Rendering frequency low (turn-based) → no heavy perf constraints initially.

**Known Constraints:**
- Must function gracefully in text-first Adaptive Card environment (limited interactivity compared to full canvas UI).
- Music playback not supported directly in standard chat cards → handled in Tab app phase.
- Hackathon timeline suggests lean MVP before advanced AI or theming marketplace.
- Multi-user concurrency: need idempotent move handling & concurrency token to prevent double submissions.
- Initial absence of persistence means games lost on restart (acceptable pre-alpha).
